# Puzzle-agnostic Strategy-solver
This Python implementation of a puzzle-agnostic strategy solver is a result of my Master Thesis at the TU Delft.

Implement the `AbstractPuzzle` and `AbstractStrategy` classes for your favourite puzzles, and watch them automatically get solved and rated!
As it stands only the Sudoku and Raatsel are implemented, but feel free to add more types of puzzles!

If you use this software for research, please cite [TODO add link to paper].

## Features
- Implement a model and strategies for your favourite puzzles and watch the solver give you the correct output.
- Step-by-step debugging of the solving process.
- Solve a puzzle instance with a given set of strategies.
- Calculate all reachable states from a given state with for a set of strategies.
- Time-expanded rating method to gain insight on the solving path of a puzzle.
